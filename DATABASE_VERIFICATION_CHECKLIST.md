# 🔍 Database Setup Verification Checklist

## ✅ Required Tables Created:
After running the SQL, verify these tables exist in your Supabase Table Editor:

### **Core Tables (Essential):**
- [ ] `profiles` - User profiles (fixes the 404 error)
- [ ] `challenge_categories` - CTF challenge categories
- [ ] `assessments` - CTF competitions/assessments
- [ ] `sections` - Sections within assessments
- [ ] `questions` - CTF challenges/questions
- [ ] `flags` - Answers for CTF challenges
- [ ] `enrollments` - User enrollment in assessments
- [ ] `flag_submissions` - User flag submissions

### **Extended Tables (For full platform):**
- [ ] `user_question_progress` - User progress tracking
- [ ] `challenge_instances` - VM/Docker instances
- [ ] `learning_paths` - Learning paths
- [ ] `certificates` - Certificates earned
- [ ] `achievements` - User achievements/badges
- [ ] `leaderboard_entries` - Global leaderboard
- [ ] `writeups` - User writeups

### **Legacy Tables (Should already exist):**
- [ ] `waitlist` - Email waitlist
- [ ] `invite_codes` - Invite codes
- [ ] `challenge_attempts` - Challenge attempts

## 🧪 Test the Fix:
1. Go to your app: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Try to **sign up** with a new account
3. Should work without 404 errors
4. User profile should be created automatically

## 🎯 If Still Getting Errors:
- Check Supabase logs in Dashboard → Logs
- Verify all SQL executed successfully
- Ensure Row Level Security policies are enabled
- Check that the profile creation trigger exists

## ✅ Success Indicators:
- No more "profiles table does not exist" errors
- User signup works correctly
- CTF platform features are accessible
- Admin dashboard shows tables
