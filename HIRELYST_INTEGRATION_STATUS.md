# HackCubes Hirelyst Import & Integration Status Report

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective Completed
Successfully replicated the Hirelyst challenge system flow in HackCubes with imported challenge library.

## âœ… What Was Accomplished

### 1. Challenge Library Import
- **Imported 10 questions** from Hirelyst's `questions_rows.csv`
- **Imported 14 flags** from Hirelyst's `flags_rows.csv`
- **Preserved original IDs** for consistency
- **Mapped schemas** between Hirelyst and HackCubes databases

### 2. Database Schema Alignment
- Fixed import script to match HackCubes schema:
  - `name` instead of `question_text`
  - `score` instead of `points`
  - `solution` instead of `source_code`
  - `template_id` and `instance_id` for AWS instance management

### 3. Frontend Code Updates
- Updated Question interface to match database schema
- Fixed instance detection logic: `(question.template_id || question.instance_id)` instead of `instance_type`
- Updated field references throughout the UI component

### 4. Assessment Structure
- Created "Sample CTF" assessment with imported challenges
- Organized into sections: Web Security, Network Security, Misc
- Proper question ordering and scoring totals

## ðŸš€ Key Features Working

### Instance Management (AWS-backed)
- **Network Security challenges** with `template_id` values imported
- **Instance controls** shown for challenges with infrastructure requirements
- **Start/Stop/Restart** functionality via AWS Lambda integration
- **Single-instance enforcement** for Network Security challenges

### Challenge Flow
- **Assessment enrollment** and progress tracking
- **Flag submission** and scoring system
- **Timer management** and auto-submission
- **Background polling** for instance status updates

### Admin Portal
- **Assessment creation** and management
- **Section organization** with challenge assignment
- **Assessment details page** with challenge library integration

## ðŸ“‹ Imported Challenge Examples

### Network Security Challenges (With Instances)
1. **Techfront Solutions** - `template_id: lt-0cb8327cecfab4c8f`
2. **ShadowAccess** - `template_id: lt-062965b335504fcc5`
3. **Cloudsafe Solutions** - `template_id: lt-08e367739ac29f518`
