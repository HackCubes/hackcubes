# 🔐 Fix EKS Cluster Permissions

## 🎯 The Problem
Your AWS user `arn:aws:iam::082010050918:user/Devansh` can access EKS APIs but **cannot create resources inside the cluster** due to Kubernetes RBAC permissions.

## 🛠️ **Solution Options:**

### **Option 1: Install kubectl + Add User Permissions (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1: Install kubectl**
```bash
# Download kubectl for Windows
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.28.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe"

# Or using winget
winget install Kubernetes.kubectl

# Or download from: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
```

#### **Step 2: Add Your User to EKS Cluster**
You need to add your user to the cluster's access control. This requires someone with cluster-admin access to run:

```bash
# Get current aws-auth ConfigMap
kubectl get configmap aws-auth -n kube-system -o yaml

# Edit the aws-auth ConfigMap to add your user
kubectl edit configmap aws-auth -n kube-system
```

**Add this section to the ConfigMap:**
```yaml
mapUsers: |
  - userarn: arn:aws:iam::082010050918:user/Devansh
    username: devansh
    groups:
    - system:masters
```

### **Option 2: Use Different AWS User/Role**

If you have access to the AWS user/role that **created the EKS cluster**, use those credentials instead:

```bash
# Configure with cluster creator credentials
aws configure

# Then retry your challenge instance
```

### **Option 3: Quick Test with Existing Access**

Since you can describe the cluster, let's try a workaround by updating the Kubernetes config to use your current credentials:

#### **Step 3a: Add AWS credentials to .env.local**
```env

```

#### **Step 3b: Test the simplified approach**
If you have limited permissions, we can modify the code to use a different namespace strategy that might work with your current access.

## 🎯 **Quick Verification Steps:**

### **Check Your Current Permissions:**
```bash
# Install kubectl first, then run:
kubectl auth can-i create namespaces
kubectl auth can-i create pods
kubectl auth can-i create services
```

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ All should return "yes" for full access
- ❌ "no" means you need permissions added

## 🚀 **Alternative: Demo Mode**

If you can't get full EKS permissions immediately, I can modify the code to:
1. Use a fixed namespace instead of creating new ones
2. Simulate successful deployments for testing
3. Log what would happen without actually creating resources

This would let you verify the migration logic works while you sort out the permissions.

## 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. **If you can install kubectl**: Follow Option 1
2. **If you have cluster-admin access**: Add your user to aws-auth ConfigMap  
3. **If limited access**: Let's try the demo mode approach
4. **If you have other AWS credentials**: Use those instead

**Which option would you prefer to try first?**
